# ProdigyTech Data Science Internship - Task 01

## Task Description

Task 01 of the ProdigyTech Data Science Internship involves creating visualizations to represent categorical or continuous distribution. The visualizations are developed using Tableau, focusing on creating bar charts and histograms to effectively illustrate the data.

## Visualizations

In this task, I have created several bar charts and histograms to analyze and present the distribution of continuous data. These visualizations help in understanding the demographic patterns and trends within the dataset. As it was mentioned that we can use any dataset, I have used the Salary_Data dataset from kaggle for this Task 01 to visualize more effectively.

## Tools Used

- *Tableau*: For creating interactive and insightful visualizations.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this task is the "Salary Data" dataset, which can be downloaded from [this Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data).

## Visualizations Overview

1. *Bar Charts*: 
   - Various bar charts to show different aspects of the categorical or continuous distribution.
2. *Histograms*: 
   - Histograms to illustrate the frequency distribution of different categorical or continuous segments.

## How to View the Visualizations

1. Download the dataset from the provided Kaggle link.
2. Open the Tableau file (with a .twb or .twbx extension) included in this repository.
3. Explore the different sheets to view the bar charts and histograms created.

## Repository Structure

- Salary_data: Contains the dataset used for the visualizations.
- PRODIGY_DS_01: Contains Tableau file with the created visualizations.
- README.md: This file, providing an overview of the task and how to use the repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with viewing the visualizations:

1. Ensure you have Tableau installed on your machine.
2. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohithsairamreddy/salary-data).
3. Open the Tableau file from the visualizations/ directory.
4. Explore the different visualizations to understand the categorical or continuous distribution.

## Conclusion

This task was a great opportunity to apply data visualization techniques using Tableau. The bar charts and histograms created provide a clear and concise view of the categorical or continuous distribution within the dataset.
